            <p>I'm willing to bet I'm the only professional athlete's resume that you're going to find in your stack. Two months ago, I retired from playing pro ball for the St. Louis Cardinals. Now I'm a software engineer with about seven years of experience. Keep reading if that math doesn't seem to add up.</p>

            <p>Playing minor league baseball doesn't pay much. When I opened the envelope for my first minor league paycheck and read the amount at the bottom, I was...well, shocked would put it lightly. But, me being me, I decided I had to do something to help myself.</p>

            <p>I realized I had so much time away from the field that I could do some remote work. I began thinking: What marketable skills do I have that I can use to work remotely? I started browsing freelance job boards and saw something that I knew I could do: write code.</p>

            <p>The only problem with that was that I didn't know <i>how</i> to code yet. But, for me, that sounded like an opportunity instead of a hurdle. It was something I had always wanted to try as a hobby but maybe I could pick up some money with the skill as well. I quickly went looking for resources to learn the craft.</p>

            <p>Today, I have approximately seven years of programming experience. Ever since I learned my first HTML tag, I knew this was something I would love to do for the rest of my life. The power of computers is immense, as we all know. And you're telling me I can take control of them and make something amazing with them? Sign me up.</p>

            <p>Through the course of my career, I've gotten to at least taste every point of a full-stack Javascript experience. I consider myself a complete expert in creating front-ends with React.js and creating beautiful user experiences by utilizing APIs, ingesting data, and creating value for my clients. The front-end is where I've built my programming career thus far and I'm proud of that work.</p>

            <p>However, that's not to say that I'm purely a front-end engineer. I've created databasing schemas from scratch, leveraged Amazon Web Services to create full microservice architectures, written documentation, and built backend servers, too. I have every confidence that, given the opportunity to do backend work, I can compete with anyone.</p>

            <p>This opportunity is exactly what I've been looking for as a programmer. Because I'm a pitcher, I'm acutely aware of the contributions that Adequality's founder has made to baseball and pitching. And, because I'm a programmer, I'm also aware of just how gigantic the potential impact of the right programmatic effort could be on the sports industry.</p>

            <p>And I want to be in the trenches when that efforts gets put together - particularly when it comes to player development.</p>

            <p>To find out what my current skill set is, you can visit <Link href="/projects"><a>the project page</a></Link>. But know that I'm happy to learn anything required to make an impact on the sports world.</p>

            <p><i>Sincerely,</i></p>
            <p>Anthony Shew</p>

            <p>P.S. Yours is the best programming job posting I have seen to date. All stuff, no fluff. All the more reason I was compelled to respond to it.</p>
